# Dynamic Fitness

Dynamic Fitness is an application that allows you to find a gym that you like whether it's your basic commecial gym or a jiu-jitsu gym. You are also able to create a gym if you happened to see that it's not on the gyms list. You can input the name of the gym, the founder and a description. Then if you click on that gym it's page comes up and within that page you are able to add different workouts that they offer. You are able to also delete workouts and gyms. In the future I want to be able to implement users and likes for workouts and gyms and also reviews on gyms and workouts.
